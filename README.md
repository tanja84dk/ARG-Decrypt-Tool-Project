# ARG Decrypt Tool Project

My small project creating a decrypting tool to use in ARG ( Alternate Reality Game )

At this time its only able to decrypt base64 encoded text but more to come

> #### What does the tool?
>
> - Right now the tool is able to encode and decode base64 encoding from txt file and input.
> - run main.py to start the tool without any arguments.

> #### About The Tool
>
> - Menu option 1 Base64.  
>   This is where the options for encoding or decoding Base64 text.  
>   Possible both from single string file and a .txt file.
> - Menu option 2 8Bit Binary.  
>   This is where the options for encoding or decoding 8Bit Binary text.  
>   Because of the length of 8Bit Binary strings its then only posible to encode and decode from a .txt file.  
>     
>   All output from encoding and decoding will be saved in seperate .txt files in the directory and they are prepended date and time stamp to not overwrite any of your results
